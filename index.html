Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to create a website with a canvas and boarder. 
The app should include 4 buttons that, when pressed, draws a rectangle, shows your name, loads an image, and clears the canvas, respectively. 
We will continue to expand our knowledge of coding by learning new techniques, navigating Javascript, HTML, and CS, as well as larning to better troubleshoot issues within code.
